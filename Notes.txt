Topic: You can delete a branch using the git branch command

* You can delete a branch using the git branch command, along with the -d (or --delete) flag.
  If you attempt to delete a branch that has not been merged yet, Git will error out. If you are absolutely sure you want to delete an unmerged branch, 
  you’ll have to use the -D (uppercase “D”) flag with the git branch command.    
  A branch is always based on a commit. If you know the ID of the commit you want to use as the basis for a branch, 
  you can supply it to the git branch command: git branch branch-name commit-ID

Topic: check git log command

1: Check git log with N number of commit  (git log --oneline -n N)
2: git log --preety=online

we are comparing the index with the working directory git diff --cached

The output of the git diff command shows me all the things I have changed. 
Why not just copy and paste them back in my editor? Wouldn’t that have the same effect?

git rm command takes the paths of one or more tracked files and removes them from the working directory and the index. 
git mv <file1> <file2> Rename the tracked files

git rebase --interactive HEAD~3 use for squash
git reset --mixed (--soft, --hard)
git revert <commit-id> (remove/undo changes of that specfic commit)
Case-insensitive search git grep -i cheese
The git blame command is pretty rad. It gives lots of information about a certain file, and you can easily see who changed any line of the file, including details about the commit that affected that line.
git log -p --oneline --S <word> --word-diff
git log --grep "<word>"
